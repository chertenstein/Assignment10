# Assignment10
Here's my assignment 10. I did as much as I could and a lot shows up on the page
but I'm having trouble with the API's. I want to use Spotify but I'm not sure how to go about
using their stuff. When I google spotify API's it says I need to register an app
so I'm not sure exactly what it wants from me... If I could even use it. I did look into
making my own database but I don't even know where to start with that.

I'm going for an informational page about my personal music. I have multiple social media sites
that I linked to already that work. I also have an album out that'd I'd like to link to
my artist Spotify page. (already talked about that issue above.)

I know there's a lot to do still. I need some sort of style things on the page.
Just white is boring to look at. I don't think I need to reevaluate the scope of the project.
I wanted to keep it simple already which is why I did this one. I will be willing to start over
if Spotify won't be able to work for this project.
